# Malformed UTF-8 characters

It's a list taken from [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/examples/UTF-8-test.txt](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/examples/UTF-8-test.txt)

Most of these characters can't be displayed. They are only here for testing purposes.

Look at https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings for another list of bad naughty strings.
